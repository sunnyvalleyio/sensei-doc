# Getting support

## Premium Subscription Support

Premium Support provides access to **Sunny Valley Support Center**.  Through _SVN Support Center_, you can do self service and discover helpful information or create support tickets, which gets taken care by SVN engineers with a higher priority and - with the related support option - a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\). 

When you buy a Sensei subscription, you are automatically entitled to **Premium Subscription Basic Support**.  Basic support enables you to create tickets and get help from Sunny Valley Networks engineers directly. 

Please note that Basic Support does not provide response time guarantees. If you're looking for more advanced support options backed by a SLA, you can always request it from our partners. If you've purchased Sensei Subscription through one of our channel partners, they have several support options available that are tailored to your specific needs.
