# Getting support

## Premium Subscription Support

Premium Support provides access to [**Sunny Valley Service Desk**](https://sunnyvalley.atlassian.net/servicedesk/).  Through _SVN Service Desk_, you can do self service and discover helpful information or create support tickets, which gets taken care by SVN engineers with a higher priority and - with the related support option - a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\). 

To access **Sunny Valley Service Desk**, follow this URL: [**https://support.sunnyvalley.io**](https://support.sunnyvalley.io) 

When you buy a Sensei subscription, you are automatically entitled to **Premium Subscription Basic Support**.  Basic support enables you to create tickets and get direct help from Sunny Valley Networks engineers. 

Please note that Basic Support does not provide response time guarantees. If you're looking for more advanced support options backed by a SLA, you can always request it from our partners. If you've purchased Sensei Subscription through one of our channel partners, they have several support options available that are tailored to your specific needs.  



## Freemium  Support 

Forum, Gitlab and e-mail are three methods from which you can get help. We recommend the OPNsense forum and Gitlab.
