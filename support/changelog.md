# Changelog

## 0.8.0.beta1 - ETA March 1, 2019

* **IPv6 Support** As promised - now Sensei has IPv6 support.
* **Virtio interface support** There were many requests that we make Sensei run on virtual interfaces like QEMU/KVM/Proxmox virtio. Sensei 0.8 combined with OPNsense 19.1.2 new netmap enabled kernel, you can now run on virtio interfaces This is also a big enabler to run OPNsense and Sensei on most of the major Cloud and VPS operators. More info on that: [https://forum.opnsense.org/index.php?topic=11477.0](https://forum.opnsense.org/index.php?topic=11477.0)
