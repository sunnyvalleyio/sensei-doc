# Web Control

Sensei keeps an eye of web pages visited through your network, and does its job when someone hit an unwanted page silently. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The engine processes the request, queries to "SVN Cloud" in real-time and decides whether it will be blocked or allowed. We check against 140+ Million Websites, under 120+ categories in milliseconds.

## Categories

### Web Categories

Websites are categorized by their type and listed in a click-to-open tree-view for convenient access.

{% hint style="info" %}
"Web Categorization DB" is maintained by Sunny Valley Networks. You can check how fast we're working on [Status &gt; Cloud Node Status](status.md#cloud-node-status)

## User Defined Categories

Sensei's user-oriented approach puts you to the center of the control-universe. You can define your own web categories, add sites under them, and manage their status with just one click.

### Adding a new user category 

* Click on the folder icon on the left side of the menu. It will pop-down the tree and bring out the existing user-defined categories if any.
* Enter the name for the new category.

### Adding a new site under the category

* Just after new category created, a new modal dialog asks for the very first site.
* Enter your target site URL and click on "Add Site" button.

* When you're done with adding new sites to the category, close the dialog.
* Click on the green check icon to the left to block your new added category.
* Hit save to activate your new rules.

### Editing a user defined category

* When you mouse over your user-defined category, you'll get two new icons.
* Edit `pencil` icon opens up the modal dialog to add new sites.
* Delete `cross` icon deletes the whole category with all sites under it.
