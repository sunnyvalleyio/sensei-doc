# Web Control

Sensei keeps an eye of web pages visited through your network, and does its job when someone hit an unwanted page silently. 

The engine process the request, queries "SVN Cloud" in realtime, and decides whether it will be blocked or allowed.  We check against 140+ Million Websites, under 120+ categories in milliseconds. 

## Categories

### Web Categories

{% hint style="info" %}
"Web Categorization DB" is maintained by Sunny Valley Networks. You can check how fast we're working on [Status &gt; Cloud Node Status](status.md#cloud-node-status)
{% endhint %}

Web sites are categorized by their type, and listed in a click-to-open treeview for a convenient access.
