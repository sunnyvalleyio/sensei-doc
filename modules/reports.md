# Reports

Reports module is the place where you see what is happening on your network, which rules are hitting and more in real-time.

{% hint style="info" %}
All reports have their charts set up. You'll be provided with the charts relevant to the report you're on.
{% endhint %}

## How to Use Drill Down Filter

You can drill-down to the data you see on the page by right clicking on any of the charts displayed, and filter out the data. It will be automatically applied to all the charts as is.

## How to Use Generic Filter

You can filter out the reports by clicking "+ Add Filter" button on top of each report page.

## The Explorer and How to Use It

Sensei's "Explorer" module displays and lets you browse the relevant data about the report you're on. All reports have slightly different versions of the explorer. You'll notice how the explorer consolidates the data and changes functionality based on the report you're exploring.

{% hint style="info" %}
To open up "The Explorer", click on the button upper right corner of the page. 
{% endhint %}

Each report page has an explorer screen that renders detailed connection logs with a searchable, sortable fashion.

### Dynamic Search

There is a dynamic text search area at the upper right corner of every explorer screen. It helps you to filter all the data in the grid as you type.
