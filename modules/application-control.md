# Application Control

Sensei's Application Control engine works seamlessly behind the scenes when a user requests to connect through your network and process the request, uses "App DB" to decide whether it will be blocked or allowed.

{% hint style="info" %}
"APP DB" is maintained by Sunny Valley Networks. You can update it through [Status &gt; App DB Update & Reload](status.md#app-db-update-and-reload)
{% endhint %}

## Categorization

Applications are categorized by their type, and listed in a click-to-open treeview for a convenient access.

## Dynamic Search

You can use dynamic search on top of the category list to filter out the items. We search as you type.

### Testing the results
