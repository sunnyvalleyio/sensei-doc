### 3- Cloud Reputation

The Cloud Threat Intelligence data is queried real time when anyone makes a connection through your network. It enables us to respond to malware and wireless outbreaks in real time and very fast.

The engine processes the request, queries to "SVN Cloud" in real-time and decides whether it will be blocked or allowed. We check against 140+ Million Websites, under 120+ categories in milliseconds.
