# Installing Sensei

This process is quite straight-forward and easy. You download an installer file onto the firewall and run it. Everything then gets taken care by the installer script.

{% hint style="info" %}
Sensei Community Edition is free-of-charge. You can download your copy from [https://www.sunnyvalley.io/sensei](https://www.sunnyvalley.io/sensei)  
{% endhint %}

## Connect to Your Firewall

```text
$ ssh root@your-firewall-ip
```

After a successful login, enter "8" as the option to drop to the shell

## Download & Run Sensei Installer

Once you register your copy at [`https://www.sunnyvalley.io/sensei`](https://www.sunnyvalley.io/sensei), you'll be provided with a download URL to install the latest community edition.

```text
root@fw:~ # curl https://updates.sunnyvalley.io/getsensei | sh
```

### 3- Cloud Reputation

The Cloud Threat Intelligence data is queried real time when anyone makes a connection through your network. It enables us to respond to malware and wireless outbreaks in real time and very fast.

The engine processes the request, queries to "SVN Cloud" in real-time and decides whether it will be blocked or allowed. We check against 140+ Million Websites, under 120+ categories in milliseconds.

Cloud Threat Intel settings let you;

* Enable/Disable the cloud reputation & web categorization engine
* Set local domain settings to be excluded from cloud queries

### 5- Updates & Health Check

{% hint style="info" %}
Sensei uses OPNsense package system to deliver its updates. Configure the way you receive your Sensei updates as you feel convenient.
{% endhint %}

* **Self Health Check:** If enabled "Self Health Check" monitors the system's memory, CPU, disk usage and core services if they're working correctly, and raises alerts \(still in development\) if anything goes wrong. The Check also stops the relevant services if they're consuming excessive system resources.
* **Check for Updates Automatically:** Checks automatically for the updates and creates a notification on the status page.
* **Update Databases and Threat Intelligence Data Automatically:** Checks automatically for the updates and creates a notification on the status page .
* **Enable Generation of Suppport Data:** Sensei collects supporting data during unusual events and crashes  if enabled. You can share this data when opening a ticket with us.
